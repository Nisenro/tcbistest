Business Informatics takes a systematic and analytic approach to aligning **business intelligence**, **information science**, and **computer engineering** into an **engineering science for businesses**. The core element of business informatics is a methodological approach for describing, explaining, predicting, and designing information and communication models, architectures, and systems for the business environment. Business informatics is a discipline combining several fields of study, including computer science, information technology, operations research, and management systems, to develop a new scientific foundation for business engineering.
